> # Sequence Alignment

The purpose of **ASSEMBLY** is to merge reads into larger contiguous sequences (contigs) based on their sequence similarity to each other. 
The purpose of **ALIGNMENT** is to compare the contig to a previously assembled reference genome (or transcriptome) sequence.

> Mapping
> -   A mapping is a region where a read sequence is placed.
> -   A mapping is regarded to be correct if it overlaps the true region.
> 
> Alignment
> -   An alignment is the detailed placement of each base in a read.
> -   An alignment is regarded to be correct if each base is placed correctly.

Tools used to be separated into aligners vs mappers. However these have become combined over time. However a distinction still exists. For example, studies examining SNPs and variations in a genome would be primarily alignment-oriented. However, studies focusing on RNA-Seq would be essentially mapping-oriented. The reason for this difference is that in RNA-Seq you would need to know where the measurements come from, but you would be less concerned about their proper alignment.

The limitations of alignment are: 
- sequencing errors
- genomic variation 
- repetitive elements
- multiple different transcript isoforms from same gene
- main challenge is the spliced alignment of exon-exon spanning reads
- mapping ambiguity = many reads overlap with more than one isoform
-  False positives: lowly expressed isoforms are excluded by alignment algorithms —> bias towards identifying strongly expressed genes

# Alignment Strategies

1. align reads to **genome** index to identify novel splice events. Most common approach.
2. align reads to **transcriptome** index (required transcripts to be known and annotated in the reference) - i.e. pseudoalignment. Use if you have short reads < 50bp. Using Kallisto or Salmon - much quicker but wont identify new transcripts.
4. **de novo** assembly: assemble transcripts from overlapping tags. Useful if no reference genome exists for species studied. Also if looking for complex polymorphisms that would be missed by aligning to reference.

# Which Aligner Should I Use?
~ 2005 high throughput short-read sequencers changed the face of sequencing which became much cheaper and accessible. Previously sequencing was laborious and expensive and the focus was on producing accurate long reads (1000bp). Sequencing reads longer improves alignment.  Sequencers now produce millions of short reads (50-300bp). Aligners have thus changed to adapt to short reads - rapidly select the best mapping at the expense of not investigating all potential alternative alignments.
- Short read aligners are incredible! They match > 10,000 sequences per second against 3 billion bases of the human genome.
- There is large variation in results between different aligners. A tool that prioritises finding exact matches will do so at the expense of missing locations and overlaps and vice versa.
- Limitations:
	- finds alignments that are reasonably similar but not exact (algorithm will not search beyond a defined matching threshold)
	- cannot handle very long reads or very short reads (<30bp) (become inefficient)

Aligners aim to:
1. speed up process
2. reduce amount of memory used
3. maximise quality of the alignment

Note the RNA aligners in red below:
![enter image description here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/~nf/hts_mappers/mappers_timeline.jpeg)

The main RNA-seq aligner milestones are:
1. TopHat > TopHat2. Slowish 1000mins. Low memory 4GB. Everyone used it from 2009
2. STAR. Faster 24mins. Used more memory 28GB (need a server)
3. HISAT. Faster 20mins & reduce memory 4GB

|Aligner |Speed  |Memory |Year|
|--|--|--|--|
| TopHat > TopHat2 |1000mins|4GB |2009|
|STAR|24mins| 28GB |2012|
|HISAT > HISAT2 |20mins|4GB |2016|

## Splice-aware Aligners

If you are aligning to a genome then you need a splice aware aligner:
- reads span large introns
- reads represent mature mRNA have introns removed
- but aligning back to the reference genome needs to recognise intron sites
- unless reads a short <50bp then you need a splice aware aligner

![(**a**) Five types of RNA-seq reads: (i) M, exonic read; (ii) 2M_gt_15, junction reads with long, >15-bp anchors in both exons; (iii) 2M_8_15, junction reads with intermediate, 8- to 15-bp anchors; (iv) 2M_1_7, junction reads with short, 1- to 7-bp, anchors; and (v) gt_2M, junction reads spanning more than two exons. (**b**) Relative proportions of different types of reads in the 20 million 100-bp simulated read data.](https://media.nature.com/lw926/nature-assets/nmeth/journal/v12/n4/images/nmeth.3317-F1.jpg)

Options:
-   [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf): Really fast, produces counts for you too. Straight forward RNA seq for differential gene expression analysis. Efficient. Sensitivie. Identified large number of novel splice sites.
-   [HISAT2](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3317): similar algorithms as Bowtie2/Tophat2 - but performs at much faster speeds
-   Subjunc: designed specifically for gene expression analysis.
-   BWA: the MEM algorithm of bwa supports spliced alignments.
-   BBMap: Is capable of detecting very long splicing.
- Tuxedo suite refers to the pioneering automating pipelines for RNA-seq = alignment with tophat & bowtie, and Quantification & Differential Expression with cufflinks - all now outdated. 
- The new Tuxedo suite refers to
	- alignment: hisat2
	- quantification: stringtie
	- differential expression: ballgown (R package)

## Global > Local Alignment
The aligners first align to a global index (slow) & then to a local index (faster):
- global indexing: tries to anchor the first 28 bp of the read to the reference genome > find the global location in the genome of where the read belongs. Then extends the anchor base by base. If the read crosses a splice junction it will encounter a mismatch > switch to local index.
- local indexing: align remaining bases to the downstream or upstream exon.

When choosing an aligner, we need to decide what features the aligner should provide:
-   Alignment algorithm: global, local, or semi-global?
-   Is there a need to report non-linear arrangements?
-   How will the aligner handle INDELs (insertions/deletions)?
-   Can the aligner skip (or splice) over large regions?
-   Can the aligner filter alignments to suit our needs?
-   Will the aligner find chimeric alignments?

# Reference Genomes
Reference genome sequence repositories:
**[GenCODE](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/)** - Generally for human data use 
**[ENSEMBL](http://www.ensembl.org/index.html)** : has the most detailed annotations of genomes.
**[UCSC table browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/)** - Stores large scale result tiles produced by consortia e.g. ENCODE. Contains multiple sequence alignment datasets across entire genomes.https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables
ENCODE
iGenomes
NCBI
Mouse Genome Project
Berkeley Drosphilia Project
RefSeq
[RNA-Central](http://rnacentral.org/) - non coding RNA sequencing database

* UCSC and Ensembl use different naming conventions (which impacts on analyses) - try to stick to one.
* must use Ensembl FASTA file with Ensemble GTF file. You cannot mix Ensembl with UCSC without modifying first and this isn't advised as they have different scaffolds.

## Reference Genome File Formats

### Reference Sequence
Reference sequences are **FASTA files.** Reference sequences are long strings of ATCGN letters.  

### Reference Annotation
Annotation files store start sites, exon, introns. They contain spacial coordinate information describing genomic loci (2D position) according to their pattern (chromosome, start, end) as intergers. These integers represent the left & right positions of an interval on the genome.

Both formats contain information:
- Span: start & end coordinates
- Hierarchy: feature belongs to another feature e.g. exon to a transcript
- Value: at a sapsecific coordinate
- Annotation: feature X is also characterised by Y & Z

2 types of genome formats exist:
- [BED](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1) originally designed for UCSC genome browser
- [GFF](http://mblab.wustl.edu/GTF22.html) (also its variants GFF2, GTF & GFF3)

**BED Format**
BED is 0 based, non-inclusive on the right. This means that the interval [1, 5) contains 1,2,3,4 and coordinate 1 is the second coordinate of the genome (0 is the first).
A single line record stores all the information on the block structure of a record.

3 compulsory fields: chromosome & start & end.
9 optional fields: name, score, strand, thickStart, thickEnd, itemRgb, blockCount, blockSizes, blockStarts
        	field number can vary from 3 - 12. Must be consistent within a file.

RSeQC requires BED format.

**GFF = General Feature Format**
GFF is 1 based, inclusive on both ends. This means that [1,5] contains 1,2,3,4,5 and that coordinate 1 is the first coordinate of the genome.
The relationship is built from data distributed over multiple lines. 

9 fields separated by TAB. 
* Reference sequence: coordinate system of annotation eg Chr1
* Source: annotation software
* Method: annotation type (eg gene)   	[GFF3 = Type: term from lite Sequence Ontology SOFA or accession number]
* Start Position: 1-based integer, <= stop position
* Stop Position: 0-length features (insertion sites)
* Score: sequence identity
* Strand: + = forward. - = reverse. “.” = no stranded
* Phase: codon phase for annotations linked to proteins. 0; 1; or 2 = indicates frame (bases to be removed from beginning of feature to reach first base of next codon)
* Group: class and ID of an annotation which is the parent of the current one.  	[GFF3 = Attributes: TAG=VALUE pairs - ID, name, alias, parent, target, gap]
* Source
* Type

Always use GFF based formats. [Can convert between the two formats using:](https://www.biostars.org/p/56280/)

# Alignment Workflow:

 - The aim of alignment is to produce a SAM (Sequence Alignment Map) file which contains all information on the sequencing & its alignment. After creating the SAM file there is no need to look at the FASTQ file again since the SAM contains all the FASTQ information.

![RNA-seq Flowchart - Module 1](https://github.com/griffithlab/rnaseq_tutorial/wiki/Images/RNA-seq_Flowchart2.png)

### 1. Build Index

The **index often needs updating** to match the current version of STAR.

- All short read aligners first build an index from the reference genome. Then the FASTQ sequencing files are aligned against this index.
- Index building prepares the reference genome to allow the tools to search it efficiently. It creates multiple files that should be stored near to the FASTA reference sequence.
- Can take days for large genomes to build an index. The relevant indexes have already been created and stored on the CAMP cluster in `/home/camp/ziffo/working/luscombelab-UCL`
 
Input Files = Reference genome sequence (FASTA) & Annotation file (GTF)

Create directory to store index in: `mkdir GRCh38.12_STAR_index`
Module load STAR `ml STAR`  

STAR commands have the format: `STAR --option1-name option1-value(s)--option2-name option2-value(s) ...`
To generate the index in STAR, specify the location of:
1. index directory to store the output
2. FASTA reference genome file
3. GTF annotation file
4. Overhand: read length minus 1. Read length distribution are shown in the MultiQC report. This is length of the genomic sequence around the annotated junction to be used for the splice junctions database

```bash
ml STAR # version 2.7.1 noted in Log.out file

```

think of --sjdbOverhang as the maximum possible overhang for your reads. Ideally 1- read length"
```

The above code is resuable and applicable to all situations by editing the $changable elements.
The "hard-coding" looks like this (very long and difficult to edit):
```bash

```Check it is running using `myq`
If it isn’t seen there then `ls` the folder → look for output file named “slurm…”
Open slurm file: `more slurm…` which will explain outcome of file eg FATAL INPUT PARAMETER ERROR
 
### 2. Align each FASTQ file to the Index
ml STAR
ml Python/3.5.2-foss-2016b
ml SAMtools

* Sample distributed over X flow cell lanes → X fastq files per sample
* STAR merges the X files if multiple file names are indicated (other align tools don't)
* Separate the file names with a comma (no spaces)
* Create directory to store STAR output `mkdir alignment`

By allocating all file names to the `$INPUT` term it means all the FASTQ files are read together (see example further down) but it is best to do each separately - can use [snakemake](http://slides.com/johanneskoester/snakemake-tutorial#/) - this makes it easier to see if there is an alignment error in each individual sequencing file:

* List fast.qz files separated by commas and remove white spaces:

`INPUT= ls -m /camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/airals/fastq_files/SRR5*.fastq| sed 's/ //g' | echo $INPUT | sed 's/ //g'`

`ls -m` list, fill width with a comma separated list of entries all the fastq files.
`sed` remove a space from each file name
`echo` displays a line of text - in this case it lists all the file names  - in this case the pipe to echo is to remove new spaces that are created between multiple lines. no space after FILES - with space after it thinks FILES is command.
`sed` = stream editor - modify each line of a file by replacing specified parts of the line. Makes basic text changes to a file - `s/input/output/g`

```bash
#set the index
IDX=/camp/home/ziffo/home/genomes/index/GRCh38.p12_STAR_index
#set the fastq sequencing file to read in
READ1=/camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/airals/reads/D0_samples/trimmed_depleted/*.sam
#set the paired fastq sequencing file to read in (for paired end data only)
READ2=
#set name under which to store the BAM file output
BAM=/camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/airals/alignment_STAR/D7_samples/trimmed_filtered_depleted/SRR5483788_

#SEND ALIGNMENT AS SBATCH
sbatch -N 1 -c 8 --mem 40G --wrap="STAR --runThreadN 1 --genomeDir $IDX --readFilesIn $READ1 --outFileNamePrefix $BAM --outFilterMultimapNmax 1 --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate --outReadsUnmapped Fastx --twopassMode Basic"
```

The above script needs editing for each sequencing file (redundant). 
To create a script that runs all sequencing files (non-redundant) you can use a for loop or snakemake.

**For Loop**

```bash
# create all time point output folders
mkdir D0_samples D7_samples D14_samples D21_samples D35_samples D112_samples

#set the index
IDX=/camp/home/ziffo/home/genomes/index/GRCh38.p12_STAR_index
# set timepoint folders
TIMEPOINT=/camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/airals/reads/D*_samples

## run multiple alignments using in for loop
for SAMPLE in $TIMEPOINT;
do
DAY=`echo $SAMPLE | grep -E -o 'D[0-9]+_samples'`
#set the sequencing file to read in (use trimmed_depleted output)
READ1=$SAMPLE/trimmed_depleted/*.fastq
	for REPLICATE in $READ1 
	do
	#set BAM output file aligned to human genome
	BAM=/camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/airals/alignment/$DAY
	SRRID=`echo $REPLICATE | grep -E -o 'SRR[0-9]+'`
	sbatch -N 1 -c 8 --mem 40G --wrap="STAR --runThreadN 1 --genomeDir $IDX --readFilesIn $REPLICATE --outFileNamePrefix ${BAM}/${SRRID}_ --outFilterMultimapNmax 1 --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate --outReadsUnmapped Fastx --twopassMode Basic"
	# Index each BAM file as they are produced
	samtools index ${BAM}/${SRRID}_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam
	done
done
```

Biostars approach to alignment:
```bash
# Create output folder
mkdir -p bam
# set the index
IDX=/camp/home/ziffo/home/genomes/index/GRCh38.p12_STAR_index

for SAMPLE in VCP CTRL;
do
    for REPLICATE in 1 2 3;
    do
        # Build the name of the files.
        READ1=reads/${SAMPLE}_${REPLICATE}_R1.fq
        BAM=bam/${SAMPLE}_${REPLICATE}.bam
        echo "Running STAR on $SAMPLE"
        # Run the aligner.
        STAR --runThreadN 1 --genomeDir $IDX --readFilesIn $READ1 --outFileNamePrefix $BAM --outFilterMultimapNmax 1 --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate --outReadsUnmapped Fastx --twopassMode Basic
        # Index each BAM file as they are produced
        samtools index $BAM
    done
done

#Place the above into a script with atom & save in appropriate folder, name it `align.sh` and run it with
bash align.sh
```

**Snakefile**
- write the following rules in Atom and save the file in the appropriate directory
```bash
rule star_map:
input: 
	index="/camp/home/ziffo/home/genomes/index/GRCh38.p12_STAR_index"
	sample="/camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/airals/fastq_files/{sample}.fastq", 
output: 
	"/camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/airals/alignment_STAR/{sample}.sam"
shell:
	"STAR --genomeDir {input.index} --readFilesIn {input.sample} --outFileNamePrefix {output}_ --outFilterMultimapNmax 1 --outReadsUnmapped Fastx --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate --twopassMode Basic --runThreadN 1"

#dry run workflow:
`snakemake -np /camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/airals/alignment_STAR/{sample}.sam`
#execute workflow:

## STAR output

The [STAR manual](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf)  has all the explanations on how to write the STAR command and fine tune parameters including:
* multi-mapped reads
* optimise for small genomes
* define min & max intron sizes 
* handle genomes with >5000 scaffolds
* detect chimeric & circular transcripts
if files are compressed add `--readFilesCommand gunzip -c`
STAR ENCODE options: `outFilterMultimapNmax 1` max number of multiple alignments allowed for a read - if exceeded then read is considered unmapped i.e. when 1 is used this only identifies unique reads and removes multimapped reads. This is generally accepted.

#`STAR` will perform the alignment, then extract novel junctions which will be inserted into the genome index which will then be used to re-align all reads
#`runThreadN` can be increased if sufficient computational power is available

**STAR Output Files**
 - Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam - the loci of each read & sequence
 - Log.final.out - summary of alignment statistics
 - Log.out - commands, parameters, files used
 - Log.progress.out - elapsed time
 - SJ.out.tab - loci where splice junctions were detected & read number overlapping them
 - Unmapped.out.mate1 - fastq file with unmapped reads

1. check the slurm file: `more slurm-132XXX.out`

2. check the summary of the output: `cat FILENAME_Log.final.out`
![summary of alignment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317454/37438378-095cb442-282d-11e8-95fd-bfecefae5b75.png)

3. check that the number of reads in the fastq files matches the STAR log output: 
`more SRR5483788_Log.final.out`
`echo $( cat /camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/airals/fastq_files/D7_samples/SRR5483789_1.fastq | wc -l)/4 | bc`

## Index BAM read alignment files
ml SAMtools

- STAR auto creates [BAM files](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/bam).  `-b`will produce a BAM file. `-s` will produce a SAM file.
- Now need to index each BAM file. The indexed BAM file format = BAM.BAI file. Inxed allows quick access to the BAM files without having to load them to memory.

for individual files: `samtools index filename_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam`

Using the STAR alignment For Loop above you can automate this with the above phase as each BAM file is produced:
```bash
for file in /camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/airals/alignment/D7_samples/trimmed_filtered_depleted/SRR5*_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam
do
	sbatch -N 1 -c 8 --mem 40 --wrap="samtools index $file";
done
```

```bash
# set timepoint folders
TIMEPOINT=/camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/airals/reads/D*_samples

for SAMPLE in $TIMEPOINT;
do
	READ=$SAMPLE/trimmed_depleted/*.fastq
		for REPLICATE in $READ
		do
			SRRID=`echo $REPLICATE | grep -E -o 'SRR[0-9]+'`
			BAM=$SAMPLE/${SRRID}Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam
			samtools index $BAM
		done
done
```

# Sequence Alignment Map (SAM/BAM) file

SAM/BAM files store read alignments.

[SAM files](https://www.biostarhandbook.com/sam/sam-flags.html) are generic nucleotide alignment format describing alignment of sequenced reads to a reference. SAM format are TAB-delimited line-orientated (each row represents a single read alignment) text consisting of 2 types of tags:
1. Header: meta-data
2. Body: longer with information on alignment.

-   The  [SAM format specification](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf)  is the official specification of the SAM format.
-   The  [SAM tag specification](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMtags.pdf)  is the official specification of the [SAM tags](https://www.biostarhandbook.com/sam/sam-flags.html).
- impossible to transform one aligners SAM file into another aligners SAM file.

![enter image description here](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/introduction/images/bam_structure.png)

## SAM header
Describes the data source, reference sequence, method of alignment. 
Each section begins with `@`then value pairs 2 letter abbreviations:
`@HD` = header line: `VN` version format, `SO` sorting order of alignments
`@SQ` = sequence directory listing `SN` sequence name aligned against (from FASTA), `LN`  sequence length, `SP` species, 
`@RG` Read Group = `ID` read group identifier, `CN` name of sequencing centre, `SM` sample name
`@PG` program ran = `PN` programme name, `VN` program version

* 1 line per chromosome
* To retrieve only the SAM header `samtools view -H`
* To retrieve both the header & alignment sections `samtools view -h`
* The default `samtools view` will not show the header section
* Print read group tags `samtools view -H filename.bam | cut -f 12-16 | head -1`. You may need to add a custom read group tag in individual bam files prior to merging with `samtools addreplacerg` using `TAG:FORMAT:VALUE`. This allows pooling results of multiple experiments into a single BAM dataset to simplify downstream logistics into 1 dataset.
`samtools view -H filename.bam`

## SAM body
* Each line corresponds to one sequenced read.
* The SAM tags are defined [here](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMtags.pdf)
* Each SAM file has 11 mandatory columns. Despite this aligners vary in how much information they put into these columns:

`<QNAME> <FLAG> <RNAME> <POS> <MAPQ> <CIGAR> <MRNM> <MPOS> <ISIZE> <SEQ> <QUAL>`

![SAM alignment section](http://felixfan.github.io/figure2016/SAMv1_3.png)


* Following the 11 mandatory fields, the optional fields are presented as key-value pairs in the format of  `<TAG>:<TYPE>:<VALUE>`, where  `TYPE`  is one of:  `A`  - Character  `i`  - Integer`f`  - Float number `Z`  - String  `H`  - Hex string
* Reads within the same SAM file may have different numbers of optional fields, depending on the aligner program that generated the SAM file. 

### 2nd column FLAG field
* compresses all mapping information on a read alignment into one single decimal number
* decimal is the sum of all the answers to Yes/No questions:
```
   Binary       Integer   Name              Meaning 
000000000001       1     PAIRED          Read paired
000000000010       2     PROPER_PAIR     Read mapped in proper pair
000000000100       4     UNMAP           Read unmapped
000000001000       8     MUNMAP          Mate unmapped
000000010000      16     REVERSE         Read reverse strand
000000100000      32     MREVERSE        Mate reverse strand
000001000000      64     READ1           First in pair, file 1
000010000000     128     READ2           Second in pair, file 2
000100000000     256     SECONDARY       Not a primary alignment 
001000000000     512     QCFAIL          Read fails platform/vendor quality checks
010000000000    1024     DUP             Read is PCR or optical duplicate
100000000000    2048     SUPPLEMENTARY   Supplementary alignment
```

* To decode the FLAG integer into plain english [click here](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html).

`samtools flagstat` assesses the FLAG field and prints a summary report: 
`samtools flagstat Aligned.sortedByCoord.bam`

### 6th Column **CIGAR** (Concise idiosyncratic gapped alignment report string) field
CIGAR string letters M, I, D etc to indicate how the read aligned to the reference sequence. 

![CIGAR string](http://felixfan.github.io/figure2016/SAMv1_5.png)

The sum of lengths of the  **M**,  **I**,  **S**,  **=**,  **X**  operations must equal the length of the read. Here are some examples:
![enter image description here](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/introduction/images/cigar.png)

##  **Alignment scoring**

For each base alignment the options are:
	- `-` a space
	- `|` match
	- `.` a mismatch

Scoring is based on the value you associate with a match, mismatch or a space. Alignment algorithms find the arrangement that produce the maximal alignment score. Example scoring matrix:
	- 5 points for a match.
	- -4 points for a mismatch.
	- -10 points for opening a gap.
	- -0.5 points for extending an open gap.
- Modifying the scoring algorithm can dramatically change the way that the sequence is aligned to the reference. See [this example](https://www.biostarhandbook.com/align/misleading-alignments.html) where reducing the gap penalty from -10 to -9 actually corrects the alignment. This setting means that 2 matches (5 + 5 = 10) overcomes a penality gap open (9). Thus to achieve a higher overall score the aligner will prefer opening a gap anytime it can find two matches later on (net score +1). 
- [EDNAFULL](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/matrices/NUC.4.4) is the default scoring choice for all aligners.

## BAM versus SAM
- BAM file = Binary Alignment Map - human readable TAB-delimited compressed. BAM files are binary, compressed and sorted representation of SAM information with alignment coordinates allowing fast query on info by location. Used to exchange data as it quicker than SAM.
- Bigger than gzipped SAM files as they are optimised for rapid access (not just size reduction). SAM files are human readable, BAM are compressed. BAM are much smaller. 
- for SAM files you can run other commands on them eg head FILENAME.sam whereas BAM files need to be run through samtools i.e. `samtools view FILENAME.bam | cut -f 2 | head`

## Convert BAM > SAM
```bash
#set BAM input files
BAM=/camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/airals/alignment/D7_samples/trimmed_filtered_depleted/SRR54837*_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam
#set output file directory
OUT=/camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/airals/alignment/D7_samples/trimmed_filtered_depleted/

#run samtools on each BAM file separately
for SAMPLE in $BAM
do
	SRRID=`echo $SAMPLE | grep -E -o 'SRR[0-9]+'`
	sbatch -N 1 -c 8 --mem=40GB --wrap="samtools view -h $SAMPLE > ${SRRID}.sam"
done

# set timepoint folders
TIMEPOINT=/camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/airals/alignment/D*_samples

for SAMPLE in $TIMEPOINT;
do
BAM=$SAMPLE/*Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam
echo "Running timepoint $SAMPLE"
	for REPLICATE in $BAM
	do
	SRRID=`echo $REPLICATE | grep -E -o 'SRR[0-9]+'`
	sbatch -N 1 -c 8 --mem=40GB --wrap="samtools view -h $REPLICATE > $SAMPLE/${SRRID}.sam"
	echo "Running sample $SRRID"
	done
done
```

or alternatively: 
`samtools view -h FILENAME_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam > FILENAME_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.sam`
Convert a BAM file into a SAM file (including the header): `samtools view -h FILENAME.bam > FILENAME.sam`
Compress a SAM file into BAM format (-Sb = -S -b)" `samtools view -Sb FILENAME.sam > FILENAME.bam`
To peak into a SAM or BAM file: `samtools view FILENAME.bam | head`

### BED format
BAM files can be massive. Often we are only interested in a focused subset of the reference genome. These region of interest subsets are speficied in BED files. To make files smaller you can use only the BED file which are accepted by BAM manipulation tools eg SAMTools, piccard

### CRAM format
Similar to BAM (binary compressed) but smaller as some compression is in the reference genome.
Sometimes you need the reference genome information so these arnt always appropriate.
Supported by samtools
Concerted effort to move from BAM to CRAM.

# Manipulate SAM/BAM files
There are 4 major toolsets for processing SAM/BAM files:
- [Picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) - Java tools for manipulating high throughput sequencing data
- [BAMtools](https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools/wiki/Tutorial_Toolkit_BamTools-1.0.pdf) - read, write & manipulate BAM genome alingment files . `ml BamTools`
- [SAMTools](http://www.htslib.org/) - interact with high throughput sequencing data, manipulate alignments in SAM/BAM format, sort, merge, index, align in per-position format. SAMTools help page = `samtools --help` Usage:   `samtools <command> [options]`

5 key SAMTool commands:
1. Indexing
2. Editing
3. File operations (aligning, converting, merging)
4. Statistics
5. Viewing

## Sort BAM files

- BAM files are usually sorted by **position** coordinates. This allows rapid access to the huge BAM file.
- Some tools require BAM files to be sorted by **read name** usually when we need to identify both reads of a pair.

## Filter BAM files

Unlike other aligners, STAR already creates separate bam files of aligned and unmapped.
Use FLAGS to filter using samtools: `-f` flag includes matches; `-F` flag includes mismatches. Flag `4` indicates unmapped.  

### Overview

Count alignments that were aligned: `samtools view -c -F 4 filename.bam`
Get overview of alignments: 
report of flags `samtools flagstat filename.bam` 
report on how many reads align to each chromosome `samtools idxstats filename.bam` 
report on flags `bamtools stats -in filename.bam`

Calculate the depth of coverage: `samtools depth filename.bam | head`  or `bamtools coverage -in filename.bam | head`
Count reads that have multiple alignments `samtools view -c -F 4 -f 256 filename.bam`
Count supplementary (chimeric) alignements `samtools view -c -F 4 -f 2048 filename.bam`
Count primary (non supplementary & non secondary) alignments `samtools view -c -F 4 -F 2304 filename.bam`

### Filter by mapping quality

Filter on mapping quality using `-q` flag:
Count number of reads with mapping quality >20 
`samtools view -c -q 20 filename.bam`

Create bam file with mapping quality (Phred Scale) >= 20
`samtools view -h -b -q 20 FILENAME.bam > high_mapq_reads.bam` 

Create BAM with uniquely aligned reads (STAR gives uniquely aligned reads a mapping quality of 255 so pull reads with mapping quality = 255 `samtools view -h -q 255 FILENAME.bam > uniquely_aligned_reads.bam` .  

### Other Filtering

Create BAM file with only reads aligned to reverse strand:
- sort the BAM file (A-Z; 0-9) and count the adjacent lines which are identical using `samtools view FILENAME.bam | cut -f 2 | sort | uniq -c`
- Then, create file with the specific feature e.g. reverse reads (FLAG = 16 in column 2): `samtools view -h -f 16 FILENAME.bam > reverse_reads.bam`

Create SAM file with reads of insert sizes > 1000bp use the CIGAR string (column 6 in SAM file):
- first convert BAM to SAM file ` samtools view -h FILENAME.bam > FILENAME.sam`
- use `grep` to exclude (using `-v`) lines with >3 digits (using `[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]`) followed by `N` (N means mismatch i.e. skipped bases, whereas M = match) `egrep -v "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]N" FILENAME.sam > smallinsert_reads.sam`
- Alternatively use `awk` to focus on column 6 (`$6` in CIGAR string) and exclude lines with 3 digits (using `![0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]`) then printing everything `{print $0}` and creating new file:  `awk '!($6 ~ /[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]N/) {print $0}' FILENAME.sam > smallinsert_reads.sam` 

Create SAM file with intron spanning reads:  
- use `grep` to select lines with a number of digits (using `[0-9]+`) then `M` (i.e. matches) then any number of digits again, then `N` (i.e. mismatches) then any number of digits and then M again at the end: `egrep "(^@|[0-9]+M[0-9]+N[0-9]+M)" FILENAME.sam > intron-spanning_reads.sam`
- Alternatively use awk to focus on column 6 (CIGAR string) and select the header `$1 ~ /^@/` and the 6th column with any number of digits followed by M followed by digits then N then digits the M: `awk '$1 ~ /^@/ || $6 ~ /[0-9]+M[0-9]+N[0-9]+M/ {print $0}' FILENAME.sam > intron-spanning_reads.sam`

## Merge BAM files

As you aligned each fastq file separately you have a BAM file for each fastq. At some point you will need to merge the BAM files for downstream processing.  

You can merge BAM files from each condition (VCP or CTRL) but not combine different conditions (wildtype & mutant). Dont forget there maybe batch effects between samples in the sample condition which are difficult to analyse after merging BAM files.
```bash
#run samtools merge command listing all BAM files to read in
samtools merge all_bam_files.bam filename1.bam filename2.bam filename3.bam`

#Check the new merged bam file
samtools view -H all_bam_files.bam

#index the new merged bam file (creates the BAI file which is required for downstream analysis)
samtools index all_bam_files.bam
```

# MultiQC
ml MultiQC

Generate a comprehensive & interactive report of STAR alignment Log.final.out files using MultiQC 
 
Go to the `alignment` folder with the STAR Log.final.out files in and run: `multiqc .`

Interpret the [HTML report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPbIlO_KWN0).

Compare the  alignment MultiQC HTML reports (the raw unprocessed aligned read report & the trimmed, filtered & depleted aligned read report)
